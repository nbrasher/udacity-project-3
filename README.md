## Udacity Project 3: Problems vs. Algorithms
Nathan Brasher - 1.21.19  

My solutions to each problem in the project are stored in folders named `problem_1/` through `problem_7/`. Each folder contains a code file like `problem_1.py` that will run from the command-line (with the exception of the `problem_5/Trie.ipynb` notebook), as well as a markdown file like `explanation_1.md` to explain design choices.
