# Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array  

This problem does not require a sorted array. Rather first store the max and min as the first list element, and then iterate over each list element to see if a larger or smaller element appears. This invovles a single array traversal and thus is O(n) for time complexity. The algorithm involves storing the entire list in memory for traversal, and this is also O(n) in space complexity.
