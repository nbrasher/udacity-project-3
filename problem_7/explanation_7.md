# Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

The solution to this problem was a simple Trie with the extra structure of a handler. In this case I chose the parse the input path within the `RouteTrie` class by splitting on forward slash characters "/" and discarding any empty results (as happens with leading, trailing or repeated forward slashes).

The time and complexity of traversing the Trie is best case O(1) and worst case O(n) where n is the number of paths and handlers. The best case, all words in the Trie have a common path (like '/home' and '/home/user') in which case the algorithm will only take as long as the longest path to traverse. In the worst case where no paths are shared (like with '/home/user' and '/other/path') then each path will be in a separate branch that must be traversed, taking both O(n) storage and time to traverse.
